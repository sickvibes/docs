# ðŸ’° Bounties

Bounties are a great way to [start contributing to VIBES](contributing/) if you aren't sure where to begin. They are relatively simple, clear tasks that can be done to contribute to the protocol. 

Bounties are used to encourage community action and contribution, or to incentivize specific tasks / projects. 

## Where To Find 'Em

Bounties are posted in the [\#ðŸ¤‘-bounties channel](https://discord.gg/UmUPEcMWad) on Discord by members of the VIBES multisig. This channel is read-only, but feel free to ask questions or clarifications in the general channel.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a cool idea for a bounty, suggest it! If it posted by the multisig, you'll get a community stipend once the bounty has been completed at least once.
{% endhint %}

## How to Get Paid

Once you've completed a bounty, share in the [\#ðŸ’ª-contributions channel](https://discord.gg/46guF9K2mK). Somebody from the multisig will issue your payment.

When considering the "worth" of these bounty payments, it's best to think of them in terms of network equity vs monetary equivalence. Until sufficient liquidity can be established, it will be difficult to swap significant amounts of **VIBES** for more liquid assets such as **MATIC** or **USDC**.

Once larger market depth and liquidity can be established, bounties may start being priced in terms of their equivalent monetary value.
