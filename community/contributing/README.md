# ðŸ’ª Contributing

VIBES is a community-owned protocol, and **VIBES** is our proof-of-work token. 

Network equity is distributed to those who contribute, with plenty of ways beyond coding to pitch in.

{% hint style="info" %}
VIBES encourages **permissionless problem solving**: build first, ask permission later. 
{% endhint %}

## How To Contribute

Contributing to VIBES is just doing anything to impact or improve the protocol. 

How this looks is entirely up to you and your skills \(or lack thereof ðŸ˜¨\). If you aren't sure where to start, ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/qDrsjcGR2F) or check out any active community bounties.

A non-exhaustive list of [ways to contribute](ways-to-contribute.md) can be used as inspo if want a bit more clarity on what this looks like.

{% hint style="info" %}
**If you are a VIBES member, you get to decide what belongs in VIBES**. You do not need permission to do anything.
{% endhint %}

## How To Get Paid

Contributions to VIBES are rewarded with network equity via **VIBES** token community stipends issued by the [VIBES multisig](../governance.md#vibes-multisig). Stipend amount and rationale is fully at the discretion of the multisig, but will always be transparently announced with justifications provided.

When considering the "worth" of these stipends, it's best to think of them in terms of network equity vs monetary equivalence. Until sufficient liquidity can be established, it will be difficult to swap significant amounts of **VIBES** for more liquid assets such as **MATIC** or **USDC**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once larger market depth and liquidity can be established, community stipends may start being priced in terms of their equivalent monetary value.
{% endhint %}

### Process

1. Do Something Cool
2. Post in the [\#ðŸ’ª-contributions channel](https://discord.gg/46guF9K2mK) on Discord
3. ???
4. Profit

The VIBES multisig will issue community stipends at the beginning of each week for contributions made in the previous week.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have questions, concerns, or complaints about how stipends are determined, please discuss them in public channels on Discord.
