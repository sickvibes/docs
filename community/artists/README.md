# ðŸŽ¨ Artists

The only prerequisite for becoming an artist is simply deciding you want to be one.

The only additional prerequisite for a VIBES artist is being hella dope ðŸ¤™.

## VIBES Artists

A VIBES artist is anyone who mints an NFT that is seeded with **VIBES** which can be claimed by collectors via [Provenance Mining](../../vibes-protocol/provenance-mining/).

## Provenance Mining Grant Recipients

Currently 60 million **VIBES** have been allocated in [Provenance Mining Grant Programs](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/treasury-allocations.md#provenance-mining-grant-program). This is a way of empowering selected artists to distribute access to large portions of network equity among their collectors and community.

Grant recipients are currently selected at the discretion of the [VIBES multisig](../governance.md#vibes-multisig).

### Artist Considerations

The VIBES multisig is looking for initial artists to award grants to during the early phase of VIBES that meet the following criteria:

* **Genuine interest in NFT and crypto culture.** Do you vibe with the ethos of the space? Are you optimistic for the future of where things are heading? Do you work to understand the broader world of crypto beyond NFTs? 
* **Unique and identifiable artist voice, style, or story**. What are you saying with your art? What aesthetics are you exploring? What role does art serve in your life? How has NFTs changed your career or life as an artist?
* **Willingness to be a VIBES ambassador**. Initial artists need to be the voices that explain VIBES to their communities and collectors. What does VIBES mean to you? Where to you want this experiment to go? What do you want your collectors to think about your VIBES pieces vs your other work? WTF is VIBES?
