# Artist Pilot Program

The first phase of allowing other artists to seed their NFTs with **VIBES** will start with a pilot program featuring hand-picked artists that kicks off at the beginning of August 2021. 

The selected artists can be identified by the **@VIBES Artist** role in Discord.

This initial group of artists was based on a set of criteria outlined [here](./#artist-considerations).

## Seeding an NFT with VIBES

Initially, seeding an NFT will require a transaction submitted by the [VIBES multisig](../governance.md#vibes-multisig) at the request of an artist. The multisig will simply act as the executive agent, the seed operation will be credited to the artist requesting it on the blockchain and the [sickvibes.xyz](https://sickvibes.xyz) site.

We will have a gradual transition to a more autonomous and permissionless system after working with the VIBES community to figure out the mechanics, and after we've had some time to see how artists approach this overall. This transition will not require redeploy or disrupting any seeded NFTs.

### Process

* If you are part of the pilot program, decide on a piece you'd like to seed
* Tag the **@VIBES Multisig** in the private **\#artists** channel and provide the following information:
  * When you would like an NFT seeded \(you must own the NFT\). 
  * The total mineable value of the piece in **VIBES**
* The following constraints apply:
  * Mining rate must be 1,000 **VIBES** / day
  * Total mineable value must be at least 90,000 **VIBES** \(~3 months\)
  * Total mineable value must not be more than 1,095,000 **VIBES** \(~3 years\)
* The following are entirely up to you:
  * How much you sell it and the auction / sale mechanic you use
  * If you give it away to collectors or a friend vs sell to top bidder
  * If you keep it, burn it, or give it away
  * How you explain what VIBES is, what provenance mining is, etc
  * If you create several pieces with smaller lifetime values vs a few pieces with larger lifetime values

ðŸ¥³ Have fun! This is your opportunity to explain VIBES in your own words and to integrate on-chain token mechanics within your story and works as an artists.

**The answer to "What is VIBES?" is entirely up to YOU.** The community voted to give this initial group of artists 30 million **VIBES** to experiment within the sandbox -- let's see where this goes.
