# ðŸ’ª Contributing

VIBES is a community-owned protocol, and **VIBES** is our proof-of-work token. 

Network equity is distributed to those who contribute, with plenty of ways beyond coding to pitch in.

{% hint style="info" %}
VIBES encourages **permissionless problem solving**: build first, ask permission later. 
{% endhint %}

## How To Contribute

Contributing to VIBES is just doing anything to impact or improve the protocol. 

How this looks is entirely up to you and your skills \(or lack thereof ðŸ˜¨\). If you aren't sure where to start, ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/qDrsjcGR2F) or check out any active community bounties.

A non-exhaustive list of ways to contribute:

### Creative and Design

* **Create design assets**. Logos, icons, illustrations, guides, social avatars / headers. Be creative and be part of establishing the visual language and branding for VIBES.
* **Create memes**. Dank memes can earn you bags. Shitpost your way to fame and fortune.
* **Ship content**. Long-form medium posts, VIBES artist interviews / highlights, YouTube videos/guides for VIBES, etc. 

### Social and Community

* **Engage in Discord discussion**. Help answer questions, direct people to resources, discuss NFT trends, art, crypto, tech, and life.
* **Write docs and guides**. Cleanup organization and grammar, write new [guides](../resources/guides/), create more cross-links. These docs are a living product and an important resource for the protocol.
* **Social Media engagement**. Hype the collective on the timeline, share dank memes created by yourself or others. 
* **Get others Involved**. VIBES is an early-stage protocol that is looking for curious and optimistic people to shape where we go. Get em in the Discord, get stacked.
* **Host events**. Flash auctions, metaverse events, art gallery shows, etc. Reach out if you'd like some funds or art from the treasury to airdrop or raffle. 

### Product and Development

* **Product ideation and brainstorming**. What else can we do with VIBES? What are some cool things we can do with NFTs? What else should we build?
* **Build cool stuff.** Can you code web3 apps? Know how to write smart contracts? Are you a Figma wizard or UX pro? Have some awesome ideas for new products? Let's make it happen.
* **Contribute to Screensaver World.** [Screensaver](https://screensaver.world) and VIBES are independent, but aligned protocols. Help out over there and get paid in **VIBES**.

The above ideas are really just the basics. VIBES is not tied to any specific market or product, we ship cool stuff and dope art on any medium.

**If you are a VIBES member, you get to decide what belongs in VIBES**. You do not need permission to do anything.
{% endhint %}

## How To Get Paid

Contributions to VIBES are rewarded with network equity via **VIBES** token community stipends issued by the [VIBES multisig](governance.md#vibes-multisig). Stipend amount and rationale is fully at the discretion of the multisig, but will always be transparently announced with justifications provided.

When considering the "worth" of these stipends, it's best to think of them in terms of network equity vs monetary equivalence. Until sufficient liquidity can be established, it will be difficult to swap significant amounts of **VIBES** for more liquid assets such as **MATIC** or **USDC**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once larger market depth and liquidity can be established, community stipends may start being priced in terms of their equivalent monetary value.
{% endhint %}

### Process

1. Do Something Cool
2. Post in the [\#ðŸ’ª-contributions channel](https://discord.gg/46guF9K2mK) on Discord
3. ???
4. Profit

The VIBES multisig will issue community stipends at the beginning of each week for contributions made in the previous week.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have questions, concerns, or complaints about how stipends are determined, please discuss them in public channels on Discord.
