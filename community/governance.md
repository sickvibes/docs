# üèõÔ∏è Governance

VIBES is a decentralized [cryptonetwork](../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/) that is owned by the community. If you hold **VIBES**, own NFTs with **VIBES** staked inside of them, or are supplying market liquidity for **VIBES** - you have _vote power_ in the protocol. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Using your vote power to influence, control, or direct the protocol via off-chain signaling or on-chain voting is known as **digital governance**.
{% endhint %}

## Vote Power

Your VIBES vote power is a reflection of your portion of the equity you have in the VIBES cryptonetwork. 

The more vote power you have, the more influence and control you have over the protocol.

{% hint style="info" %}
Go to [sickvibes.xyz/wallet](https://sickvibes.xyz/wallet) to see your vote power.
{% endhint %}

### Membership Threshold

Currently, you must have **10,000 vote power** to get the [VIBES Member Discord role](../resources/guides/how-to-get-vibes-discord-roles.md) required to chat in the Governance channel or create a new Snapshot proposal.

There are no requirements to be a contributor or chat in the main Discord channels.

{% page-ref page="../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/where-to-get-vibes.md" %}

### Details

Vote power computation for VIBES happens entirely on-chain via the [Vote Power Adapter](../resources/architecture.md) smart contract. The strategies used can be dynamically set by the VIBES multisig.

Currently, vote power is the sum of the values computed from the following strategies:

* Current **VIBES** held in your wallet
* Underlying supply of **VIBES** for **VIBES-MATIC LP** held in your wallet. This can change over time as the market price of **VIBES** on the exchange changes. 
* Claimable **VIBES** within any VIBES NFTs held in your wallet. This will change over time as more **VIBES** are mined or **VIBES** are claimed.

{% hint style="info" %}
The upcoming [Governance Farming](../vibes-protocol/governance-farming.md) program will inflate the vote power contribution from being an LP.
{% endhint %}

## Process

VIBES is a process-minimal organization, but below is a rough outline of how we coordinate governance.

### Discord Discussion

Protocol governance starts with informal discussion on Discord. Have an idea? Want to see something changed? Float it in the chat and see what others think. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the [\#üèõÔ∏è**-governance** channel ](https://discord.gg/C5TFZVjSZ5)on Discord to discuss any ideas for changes or possible future proposals for VIBES.
{% endhint %}

### Off-chain Signaling

VIBES uses [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/sickvibes.eth) for off-chain signaling, which lets you securely vote by using your web3 wallet to cast a signed ballot. 

Off-chain signaling is great for gauging community consensus around how to use shared resources or signal support for a change in the protocol. Feel free to use Snapshot in more creative ways if you think it'd be helpful or fun.

Don't feel like a Snapshot vote needs to be setup for everything \(we build first and ask for permission later\), but it can be a great way to encourage community involvement and allow people to voice their opinion

{% hint style="info" %}
**Snapshot is just a tool**: since it's not on-chain it's not binding except at the "social layer". 
{% endhint %}

## Organization

The organization of VIBES is intentionally very flat, simple, and non-prescriptive.

We are an early-phase protocol and are avoiding having explicit roles and favor open, permissionless contribution.

### VIBES Multisig

The VIBES multisig members where chosen by @bvalosek in the initial phases of VIBES based on mutual trust, friendship, crypto fluency, and support of both the VIBES project and the [BVAL NFT project](../resources/updates/prologue.md) that started it.

The multisig is currently a social-layer coordination group until Gnosis deploys their Safe product later in July 2021. It's possible that responsibilities of the multisig are eventually replaced with more decentralized processes.

The multisig is responsible for:

* Determining [community stipend](contributing.md) payouts
* Selecting the initial artists to receive provenance mining [grants](../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#provenance-mining-grant-program) 
* All treasury transfers
* [Smart Contract](../resources/architecture.md) administration
* Snapshot Space configuration
* Discord administration
