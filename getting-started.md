# ðŸš€ Getting Started

Like most things in crypto, the best way to get started with VIBES is to dive in, start exploring, and ask questions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qDrsjcGR2F). 

Below is a semi-linear approach you can use if you are at the very start of your journey, or want a bit more of a guide on getting into things.

## Getting On-Chain

If you've never used a decentralized web3 application before:

* [Install MetaMask,](https://metamask.io/) a browser extension that lets you access the blockchain from web apps in your browser. Once installed, visit [sickvibes.xyz](https://sickvibes.xyz) and it will walk you through switching to Polygon.
* [Get some MATIC](https://matic.supply/). You will need a \(very\) small amount of MATIC to use the Polygon network. $1 USD worth of **MATIC** should be enough for 100s of transactions. 

## Connecting to VIBES

Once you have your MetaMask wallet set up, you're ready to have a look around:

* [Visit sickvibes.xyz](https://sickvibes.xyz). The VIBES front page will feature a rotating assortment of for-sale VIBES NFTs you can buy
* [Check out your VIBES wallet](https://sickvibes.xyz/wallet). This will show you information about the VIBES in your wallet and owned VIBES NFTs.
* Read the [Community Overview](protocol/community.md) to get an understanding of the VIBES ecosystem.
* Read [Mining VIBES](protocol/mining-vibes/) for information on how you can earn VIBES by collecting curated art.

## Get Involved

After poking around the VIBES site a bit, it's time to get more involved

* **Support VIBES artists by buying their art**. The [VIBES site](https://sickvibes.xyz) lets you browse art that's for sale by artist, curator, or collector. Supporting artists is the best way to get involved!
* [Mine VIBES over time from the art you've collected](protocol/mining-vibes/). Support artists, and shape the future of the network.
* [Join the VIBES Discord](https://discord.gg/qDrsjcGR2F) to share your art or discuss the project.
