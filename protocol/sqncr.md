# 🎛 SQNCR

**SQNCR** is an early-stage VIBES experiment. It's the root node of an idea maze that explores the intersection of utility NFTs, collectibles, and the concept of having an **NFT serve as a crypto-native digital product**.

🚧 The **SQNCR** program is just getting started -- it might not make a lot of sense quite yet.

## What is a SQNCR?

**🖼 It's an NFT.** Like all NFTs... somebody owns it, and it can be traded, sold, purchased, etc.

**🧪 It's an experiment.** It's currently at the very first stage of development and it's likely to be a bit unclear as to what exactly it is. _That's okay_. In fact, that's kinda the point.

**🛍 It's a digital product**. In the same way you own and use your mobile phone or other consumer device... your SQNCR is something you own and use to interact with things within the VIBES ecosystem.

🌈 **It's customizable**. SQNCRs run a "shell" that determines their appearance \(in OpenSea, wallets, etc\). Shells can be hot-swapped after minting to change how they look.

⚙️ **It's a modular platform**. Users could install "modules" in their SQNCRs that give them additional functionality and state. Modules stay within a SQNCR, even across trades and sales.

## How Do I Get One?

You mint it. Currently, it costs nothing to mint, but there is a limit of the number of SQNCRs that can be minted by a single address.
