# ðŸ’Ž Mining VIBES

NFTs that have been curated into the VIBES network have a finite amount of staked **VIBES** that are made claimable over time by the owner of the NFT. 

Claiming the **VIBES** will permanently remove the **VIBES** from the NFT and transfers them to the owner's wallet. Any unclaimed **VIBES** remain within the NFT, even across sales or transfers.

{% hint style="info" %}
By allow collectors to mine **VIBES** over time, those who support artists by buying their work will have the ability to [shape the direction of the curated network](../curation.md) in the future.
{% endhint %}

## Claiming VIBES

The owner of an NFT can claim some or all of the mined **VIBES** at any time from the Token Detail page on the VIBES site. The token will continue to mine **VIBES** if there are still VIBES within the NFT.

A collector may choose NOT to claim the mined **VIBES** if they wish to re-sell the NFT in the future. An NFT with more **VIBES** remaining may sell for more than an NFT that has been "tapped" already by a previous owner.

Claimed **VIBES** can be used to curate art into the network.

In the future, additional use cases will be added for the **VIBES** token
