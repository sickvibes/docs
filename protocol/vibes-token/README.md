# ðŸ˜Ž VIBES Token

**VIBES** is not a currency nor representation of financial value. It is not a reserve-backed token. It is an experimental digital asset.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Like all tech, products, and programs in VIBES, this token is an experiment. 

**Proceed at your own risk.**
{% endhint %}

## Utility

Currently, the only utility of the **VIBES** token is curation. NFTs are curated into the VIBES network when they are infused with **VIBES**.

## Token Specification

**VIBES** is a standard ERC-20 token, which is a fungible token standard compatible with nearly every Ethereum/Polygon software and hardware wallet. The token parameters are as follows:

* **Token address**: `0xd269af9008C674B3814b4830771453D6a30616eb` \([polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd269af9008c674b3814b4830771453d6a30616eb)\)
* **ERC-20 name:** VIBES
* **ERC-20 symbol**: VIBES
* **ERC-20 decimals**: 18

The token has no pausing functionality but there is an active minter role being held by the [VIBES multisig](../governance.md#vibes-multisig). This may be revoked in the future.

Token holders may burn their tokens, which transfers to the zero-address and decreases the `totalSupply` reported by the token contract.

The token contract is verified on [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd269af9008c674b3814b4830771453d6a30616eb).

## Circulating Supply and Current Allocations

The initially minted supply for **VIBES** was 1,000,000,000 \(1 billion\).

Currently, funds have been allocated and distributed incrementally with unallocated funds held by the [VIBES multisig](../governance.md#vibes-multisig).

Total circulating supply is currently far less that the 1 billion minted \(see the [Protocol Info](https://www.sickvibes.xyz/protocol) page on [sickvibes.xyz](https://www.sickvibes.xyz/)\)
