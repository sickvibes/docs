# üåà Welcome to VIBES

\*\*\*\*[**VIBES**](https://sickvibes.xyz) **is a decentralized digital art collective and** [**cryptonetwork**](vibes-protocol/vibes-token/) **on the Polygon blockchain.**

üèóÔ∏è We're an experimental [digital community sandbox](community/governance.md) for artists, collectors,  builders, and enthusiasts who want to ship cool stuff and make killer art. We create products that push the boundaries of NFTs, digital coordination, and web3 applications.

üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è VIBES is not a company, organization, or legally recognized entity in any jurisdiction; it is an [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze) that all are invited to explore. VIBES is open-sourced and built in public.

üíñ Learn by doing. Test in prod. Bias towards action.

## Join VIBES

Becoming a [member of VIBES](community/governance.md#membership-threshold) is truly a journey of the mind and soul, but if you want to make it official, dive into the docs or hop in the [VIBES Discord](https://discord.gg/qDrsjcGR2F) to learn more.

Absolutely make sure to grab some **VIBES** \(our utility token\), and mint a **SQNCR**, the modular utility NFT of the VIBES protocol.
