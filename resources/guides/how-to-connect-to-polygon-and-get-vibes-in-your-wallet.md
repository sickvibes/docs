# ‚ùì How to Connect to Polygon and Get VIBES in Your Wallet

If you are completely new to the Polygon Matic chain, and don't know how to get Matic or VIBES, this is the guide for you! For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume you have Metamask installed, know how to use it, and have Ethereum \(ETH\) or Wrapped Ethereum \(WETH\) in it. If you don't, there are as many tutorials about how to do so as there are Punk NFTs, and they should be easy to find. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important!**   
If you just buy Matic, ETH, or WETH on an Exchange like Binance or Coinbase and send it to Metamask, it will be on the Ethereum MainNet, not the Polygon MainNet. You will need to Bridge it. **If you try to send Matic or ETH from the Polygon MainNet to an exchange, it will be lost forever!!!!** You need to bridge it back to the Ethereum MainNet first!!!!
{% endhint %}

## Adding the Polygon MainNet to MetaMask

Open Metamask, and between the fox and the pie you will see "Ethereum Mainnet." Click on this and you will be presented with a dropdown. The last item on the list is "Custom RPC." Click on this.

On  the Custom RPC page, enter the following information: 

* Network Name: Polygon Mainnet
* New RPC URL: [https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)
* Chain ID: 137
* Currency Symbol: MATIC
* Block Explorer URL: [https://explorer.matic.network/](https://explorer.matic.network/)

Click "Save," and then the Networks dropdown will have Polygon Mainnet. You can then connect to Polygon/Matic-based sites with Metamask, assuming you have switched to this. Some sites such as ScreensaverWorld will ask you to switch, some like OpenSea will connect to both the Ethereum and Polygon networks, some will switch the network automatically, and some will just not connect unless you have manually switched. You will learn which site does what over time.

## Buying Matic

Now that you have the Polygon Mainnet, you can buy Matic directly [from MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/).

Note that you will need to go through a verification process, there is a minimum purchase of US$30, and the fee is roughly equivalent to an ETH gas transaction fee. If you do not have ETH or WETH, this is an option, though. 

## Bridging ETH or WETH to Polygon

The easiest way to get Matic is to bridge some coin over. Most of the more popular tokens have pools on the Matic network, but we would recommend sticking to a very popular token like ETH, WETH, or SUSHI. Anything else might have wildly different exchange rates on Matic than it will on Ethereum, and you may lose money in the exchange. For this tutorial, we will bridge Ethereum. 

There are three main reputable bridges. The largest, and the one we recommend, is [the Polygon bridge.](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/) When you get to the page, connect your wallet. You will then be able to move Ethereum \(or whatever\) from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon Mainnet. Enter in the amount of Ethereum you want to move to Polygon, and click "Transfer." You will then get a warning about delegation \(you can ignore this\) and a notification of the gas fee. This is a simple single transaction, and will be the base level Ethereum gas, but you should still do this when gas is low.

Click "Continue" and you will get the usual signing dialogue from MetaMask, and in about 10 minutes your ETH \(or whatever\) will be on the Matic chain, and when you switch your network from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon Mainnet you will see it in the token list. 

## Converting ETH/WETH/Whatever To Matic

There is no ETH/VIBES pool, so in order to buy VIBES, you will first need to buy Matic. There are a number of exchanges you can do this on, but the VIBES pool is on QuickSwap, so that's what we usually use. Go to the [QuickSwap "Swap" page](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap), and connect your wallet, and you can then purchase Matic with your ETH/WETH/Whatever. This is very easy and fast, and you will now discover how cheap gas is on the Matic network. This transaction will only cost about 2/100 of a US cent!

## Congratulations! 

You now have Matic on the Polygon Mainnet! To work with VIBES on QuickSwap \(buying, selling, etc.\) you will need to add it, as VIBES has not yet been "blessed" by QuickSwap. To do this, in the "Select A Token" dialogue on QuickSwap, paste in the VIBES contract address, **0xd269af9008c674b3814b4830771453d6a30616eb** . You will only have to do this once, and then you can just type "VIBES" in the search window afterwards. Now you can buy or sell VIBES, and [add to the Liquidity Pool](how-to-supply-liquidity-for-vibes.md). 

There is a macro on [the SickVibes wallet page](https://www.sickvibes.xyz/wallet) to add VIBES to MetaMask. If your wallet is connected, just click \[Track VIBES in Metamask\] and it will add VIBES to your MetaMask token list automatically.
