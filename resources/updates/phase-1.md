# VIBES Phase 1

We started with [Distribution](prologue.md): getting **VIBES** to people interested in the project and active in the Polygon NFT space via the [Founders](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#founders-airdrop-program) airdrop totaling more than 1.3 million **VIBES** across 100+ addresses. 

Currently 26 of the 30 million **VIBES** for the first [provenance mining grant program](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#provenance-mining-grant-program) with @bvalosek's art have been locked in 26 1/1 Screensaver World NFTs.

### üöÄ What's next?

There is no roadmap for **VIBES**, this will never be a linear path. VIBES is an [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze): we're here to make dope art and ship cool stuff while exploring on-chain tech and coordination.

But even without a roadmap, it's important to have a sense of where we're going. The next phase of VIBES will be foundational as core parts of the [protocol thesis](../../vibes-protocol/provenance-mining/protocol-thesis.md) are tested and the initial paths of the idea maze are explored.

Proposals were passed to allocate another 30 million **VIBES** for provenance mining, and 3 million VIBES for community and builder stipends, and the site and [smart contract cluster](../architecture.md) are in active development.

### üî• Keeping Up

If you're just getting caught up with what's going on on VIBES, the following steps are recommended:

* Poke around on [sick vibes dot xyz](https://sickvibes.xyz)
* Read these docs top to bottom, starting with [Welcome To VIBES](../../)
* Read the [\#üó£Ô∏è-announcements channel](https://discord.gg/ruag8nsGpB) on Discord
* Watch the video from the [first community call](../community-calls/2021-07-01-community-call.md) \(or read the writeup\)
* Ask questions on Discord
* Start [contributing](../../community/contributing/)

Y'all ready for Phase 1 of VIBES?

## The Maze

### üé® Artists

A [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/sickvibes.eth/proposal/QmdwL7CMqaDjha3nJvm69HtHjUSH5Ma8ozhxm7YF4aYiRh) passed to allocate another 30 million **VIBES** to new artists in the form of [provenance mining](../../vibes-protocol/provenance-mining/) grants.

* What happens when new [artists](../../community/artists.md) are responsible for distributing large portions of network equity from the [VIBES treasury](../../vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#provenance-mining-grant-program) to their collectors? 
* How will artists use [VIBES Lab]() to \(re\)circulate **VIBES** inside of their NFTs in a fully permissionless way?
* Will collectors be incentivized to buy pieces injected with **VIBES**?
* Will artists approach the VIBES NFTs they make differently than their usual pieces?
* How will this round of artists explain VIBES to their collectors and followers?

### üíñ Community

A [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/sickvibes.eth/proposal/QmdwL7CMqaDjha3nJvm69HtHjUSH5Ma8ozhxm7YF4aYiRh) passed to allocate 3 million **VIBES** for community programs to reward people who contribute to VIBES via stipends and bounty payouts.

* Will people be incentivized to [contribute](../../community/contributing/) in exchange for early network equity?
* Are [bounties](../../community/bounties.md) a useful on-boarding mechanisms for new contributors?
* How will early VIBES NFT collectors use the **VIBES** mined inside of their NFTs?
* What type of emergent branding, memes, and culture can be bootstrapped via an early-phase cryptonetwork?
* How will YOU contribute to VIBES?

### ‚öôÔ∏è Protocol

Several protocol additions are being developed right now to add to the on-chain [smart contract cluster](../architecture.md) that is currently powering VIBES.

* Will [Governance Farming]() incentivize market liquidity? 
* When should VIBES deploy its [Liquidity Mining]() program?
* Should the rate and total-lifetime-value numbers used with [provenance mining](../../vibes-protocol/provenance-mining/) be tweaked?
* How can we create open standards around NFT collections and artist-owned NFT contracts that allow for interoperable curation and discovery mechanics?
* What are the specific mechanics and actions that [VIBES Party]() will allow?
