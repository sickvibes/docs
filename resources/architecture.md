## Smart Contract Architecture

![VIBES Smart Contract Cluster](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-07-08-at-10.52.26-pm.png)

* **VIBES Token** - The ERC-20 token contract for **VIBES**
* **VIBES Wellspring** - Has the **VIBES** that can be [provenance mined](../vibes-protocol/provenance-mining/) locked inside of it. Manages the bookeeping associated with claiming mined **VIBES**.
* **Token Lock Manager** - Simple lock/unlock switch for a given token ID with a time-release for unlocking. "Locking" a token just sets a flag on this contract, which can be checked by other contracts before allowing actions \(such as claiming mined **VIBES**\)
* **Vote Power Adapter** - Exposes the VIBES vote power for a given address. Maintains a list of strategy contracts that are summed together
* **Strategy Contracts** - Individual vote power strategies such as checking token balance, checking claimable **VIBES**, and checking pooled **VIBES** on QuickSwap.
