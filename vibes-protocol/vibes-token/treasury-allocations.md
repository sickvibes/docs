# ðŸ’° Treasury Allocations

The VIBES treasury is currently being allocated incrementally following the [initial minting](./) of 1,000,000,000 \(1 billion\) **VIBES** tokens.

It's possible in the future that total treasury allocations will be announced for the entire token supply, but during the initial phases of the protocol allocations will happen just-in-time.

{% hint style="info" %}
The treasury is managed by the [VIBES multisig](../../community/governance.md#vibes-multisig).

## Circulating Supply <a id="founders-airdrop-program"></a>

The following supply is considered to be in circulation from the original 1 billion tokens minted:

| Item | Amount |
| :--- | :--- |
| Founders Airdrop | 1,350,000 **VIBES** |
| Community Programs | 3,000,000 **VIBES** |
| Provenance Mining Grant Programs | 60,000,000 **VIBES** |
| **TOTAL** | **64,350,000 VIBES** |

## Founders Airdrop Program <a id="founders-airdrop-program"></a>

An initial **VIBES** airdrop program ran roughly until July 12th 2021, which included the following recipients:â€Œ

* Top 20 collectors on Screensaver v0 and v1 contracts
* All holders of **BVAL** or @bvalosek NFTs on Ethereum
* All collectors of @bvalosek Screensaver art
* All artists collected on Screensaver by @bvalosek
* Anybody showing genuine interest in the project during this time

The following amounts where airdropped:â€Œ

* **10,000 VIBES** to all addresses on the airdrop list
* **10,000 VIBES** to the nine addresses that voted on the initial test proposal
* **10,000 VIBES** to anybody providing at least 5,000 VIBES worth of VIBES-MATIC liquidity on QuickSwap

The goal of this airdrop was to distribute network equity to small artists, collectors, and crypto enthusiasts in the space and encourage a grassroots bootstrapping of market liquidity. Using large DeFi airdrop lists, targeting influencers and famous artists, or launching the protocol with liquidity mining on day 1 were all intentionally avoided to ensure opportunistic whales did not end up with large amounts of **VIBES**.â€Œ

All recipients of the initial airdrop are considered **Founding Members** of VIBES.

{% hint style="info" %}
Roughly **1,350,000 VIBES** where distributed during this airdrop.â€Œ
{% endhint %}

## Provenance Mining Grant Program <a id="provenance-mining-grant-program"></a>

The primary distribution method of VIBES is [Provenance Mining](https://app.gitbook.com/@vibes/s/vibes/~/drafts/-MeQNBFuYjdCPojZ49Xr/vibes-protocol/provenance-mining), which is managed autonomously by locking VIBES from the treasury into the [VIBES Wellspring contract](https://app.gitbook.com/@vibes/s/vibes/~/drafts/-MeQNBFuYjdCPojZ49Xr/resources/architecture).â€Œ

The Provenance Mining Grant Program allocates funds from the **VIBES** treasury to be infused into NFTs created by VIBES artists.â€Œ

This is currently a permissioned process gated by the [VIBES multisig](../../community/governance.md#vibes-multisig).

| Program | Date | Amount | Info |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## Community Programsâ€Œ <a id="community-programs"></a>

Community Programs are used to fund builder stipends and community bounties, which are used to compensate contributors to the VIBES protocol.â€Œ

All community program funds are distributed via the [VIBES multisig](../../community/governance.md#vibes-multisig).
