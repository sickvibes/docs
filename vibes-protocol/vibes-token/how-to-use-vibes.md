# 🔥 How To Use VIBES

**VIBES** is the [native token](./) for the VIBES cryptonetwork, and can be used several ways:

* Protocol Governance
* VIBES Products
* Markets

## 🏛️ Governance

VIBES is a decentralized [cryptonetwork](./) that is owned by the community. If you hold **VIBES**, own NFTs with **VIBES** staked inside of them, or are supplying market liquidity for **VIBES** - you have "vote power" in the protocol. 

Using your vote power to influence, control, or direct the protocol via off-chain signaling or on-chain voting is known as crypto governance.

You can check your VIBES vote power at [sickvibes.xyz/wallet](https://sickvibes.xyz/wallet)
{% endhint %}

### Snapshot

VIBES uses [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/sickvibes.eth) for off-chain signaling, which lets you securely vote by using your web3 wallet to cast a signed ballot.

### Governance Farming

To incentivize market liquidity and reward liquidity providers, VIBES will launch a Governance Farming program in the future that will allow LPs to farm a \(non-tokenized\) vote power multiplier by staking LP tokens. This will stack with the liquidity mining program.

## 🧪 VIBES Products

**VIBES** can be used as a utility token across various products and future experiments shipped by the VIBES collective.

{% hint style="info" %}
Being a [VIBES member ](../../community/governance.md#membership-threshold)will grant you early access to VIBES products and features via token-gating mechanisms.
{% endhint %}

### VIBES Lab

The VIBES Lab is a product in development that will allow anybody to "BYO-VIBES" and inject **VIBES** from their wallet into any NFT they own.

### VIBES Party

VIBES Party is a product in development that will allow VIBES members to exercise their protocol vote power to bid on, collect, sell and trade NFTs as a collective.

## 🤑 Markets

**VIBES** is a standard fungible ERC-20 token with several market-oriented use cases.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**VIBES** is not a currency, financial instrument, or security. 

The token and other contracts have not been audited by a third party.

No information on this website \(or any other documents mentioned therein\) is or may be considered to be advice or an invitation to enter into an agreement for any investment purpose. Further, as **VIBES** represent an experimental abstract concept, nothing on this websites qualifies or is intended to be an offering of securities in any jurisdiction nor does it constitute an offer or an invitation to purchase shares, securities or other financial product.
{% endhint %}

### Supplying Liquidity

By staking equal market values of **MATIC** and **VIBES** in the [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/add/0xd269af9008c674b3814b4830771453d6a30616eb/ETH) AMM pool, you can become a Liquidity Provider for the VIBES-MATIC decentralized exchange. When you stake **MATIC** and **VIBES** in the pool, you get back **LP** tokens, representing your liquidity position.

Liquidity providers earn fees when trades occur on the exchange, proportional to their share of the pool. Fees will accrue over time \(in both **VIBES** and **MATIC**\) and are automatically claimed when you exit the pool by turning in your **LP** tokens in exchange for your underlying **VIBES** and **MATIC** liquidity \(plus earned fees\).

Being a liquidity provider can allow for passive earning, but it's not without risk. If the VIBES-MATIC market price changes substantially from when an LP entered the pool vs when they exited, their position will be worth less than if they had just held the individual assets. This is mathematical consequence of the market-making algorithm known as "impermanent loss".

Impermanent loss can be offset by earned fees and other incentives such as the [VIBES Liquidity Mining program](../liquidity-mining.md).

### Liquidity Mining

To incentivize providing liquidity, VIBES will launch a Liquidity Mining program in the future. If you stake **VIBES** and **MATIC** in the QuickSwap pool, you can stake the **LP** tokens to earn **VIBES** rewards.

### Trading and Speculation \*

Buy low, sell high. Buy now, hodl forever. Ape in at the ATH and panic-sell the dip for substantial loss, swear off crypto forever. Do whatever.
