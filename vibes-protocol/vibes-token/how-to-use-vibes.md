# üî• How To Use VIBES

**VIBES** is the [native token](./) for the VIBES cryptonetwork with several use cases:

* Protocol Governance
* VIBES Products and Features
* Decentralized Markets

## üèõÔ∏è Governance

VIBES is a decentralized [cryptonetwork](./) that is owned by the community. If you hold **VIBES**, own NFTs with **VIBES** staked inside of them, or are supplying market liquidity for **VIBES** - you have "vote power" in the protocol.

Using your vote power to influence, control, or direct the protocol via off-chain signaling or on-chain voting is known as **digital governance**.

## üß™ VIBES Products

VIBES is a digital community sandbox; we're here to build cool stuff in the NFT space, test in prod, and ship fun experiments. 

The **VIBES** utility token will often serve a role in products or features we ship and can be a great way to gate content or functionality to users who have a stake in the protocol.

## ü§ë Markets

**VIBES** is a standard fungible ERC-20 token with several market-oriented use cases.

You could speculate \* on **VIBES**: buy low, sell high. Buy now, hodl forever. Ape in at the ATH and panic-sell the dip for substantial loss, swear off crypto forever. Do whatever.
