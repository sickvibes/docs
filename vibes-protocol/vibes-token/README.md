# ✌️VIBES Token

**VIBES** is a [governance](../../community/governance.md), utility, and coordination tool for the VIBES cryptonetwork. **VIBES** holders own a portion of the network equity of VIBES, allowing them to influence the direction of the protocol and art collective through various governance mechanisms.

**VIBES** is not a currency nor representation of financial value. It is not a reserve-backed token. It is an experimental digital asset that explores the consequences of tokenizing the act of holding art over time in a process called [Provenance Mining](../provenance-mining/).

Like all tech, products, and programs in VIBES, this token is an experiment. Proceed at your own risk.

## Token Specification

**VIBES** is a standard ERC-20 token, which is a fungible token standard compatible with nearly every Ethereum/Polygon software and hardware wallet. The token parameters are as follows:

* **Token address**: `0xd269af9008C674B3814b4830771453D6a30616eb` \([polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd269af9008c674b3814b4830771453d6a30616eb)\)
* **ERC-20 name:** VIBES
* **ERC-20 symbol**: VIBES
* **ERC-20 decimals**: 18

The token has no pausing functionality but there is an active minter role being held by the Treasury EOA for the time being. This may be revoked once a Gnosis Safe can be deployed for the VIBES multisig on Polygon sometime in July 2021.

Token holders may burn their tokens, which transfers to the zero-address and decreases the `totalSupply` reported by the token contract.

The token contract is verified on [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd269af9008c674b3814b4830771453d6a30616eb).

## Circulating Supply and Current Allocations

The initially minted supply for **VIBES** was 1,000,000,000 \(1 billion\) to the Treasury EOA.

Currently, funds have been allocated and distributed incrementally with unallocated funds held by the Treasury EOA.

Total circulating supply, including tokens locked inside of rewards or provenance mining contracts, is roughly **65 million VIBES**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Currently the treasury is managed by an EOA secured by a hardware wallet.** Once Gnosis ships their Safe product on Polygon \(see [this article](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-safes-multichain-future-b676b5b8f431)\), managed funds will be transferred to a safe controlled by the VIBES multisig, and the minter role on the token contract will be permanently removed.

In addition, on-chain mechanisms to lock and vest funds over time may be deployed for further decentralization and safety.
