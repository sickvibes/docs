# ‚ÅâÔ∏è FAQ

Terse answers to most questions:

### What is VIBES?

VIBES is a decentralized digital art collective, [cryptonetwork](vibes-protocol/vibes-token/), and experimental community of artists, collectors, builders, and enthusiasts. 

We make cool art and ship dope products on the Polygon L2 blockchain.

### Where can I browse VIBES NFTs?

[Sick Vibes Dot XYZ](https://sickvibes.xyz) ü§ô

### What is Polygon? How do I connect to VIBES?

Polygon \(previously called Matic\) is a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchains, but generally when people talk about Polygon they are talking about the Polygon PoS network that can bridge digital assets bidirectionally with the Ethereum mainnet.

VIBES currently is deployed to the Polygon PoS network.

{% page-ref page="resources/guides/how-to-connect-to-vibes.md" %}

### Why Polygon?

Polygon has effectively free transaction costs. This is crucial for reducing development and deployment hurdles and lowering user friction -- and we want to encourage experimentation and usage. 

It's also 100% EVM compatible \(can deploy the [VIBES contract cluster](resources/architecture.md) on Ethereum or any other EVM chain\) and Ethereum-aligned \(not attempting to compete with Ethereum\).

### Where do I get some VIBES?

You can mine, earn, or buy **VIBES**.

### What do I do with VIBES?

**VIBES** is the coordination and utility token of VIBES that is used in protocol governance, VIBES products, and decentralized markets.

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/vibes-token/how-to-use-vibes.md" %}

### What is the VIBES roadmap?

There is no roadmap. 

üåàVIBES is an idea maze we are all exploring together.

### How does VIBES relate to Screensaver.World?

VIBES is closely aligned with [Screensaver.World](https://screensaver.world), but there is no official association. Currently all VIBES NFTs are minted on their platform. The VIBES functionality built on top of Screensaver NFTs was done so permissionlessly -- one of the advantages of the open nature of blockchain applications and a core tenant of VIBES: 

**Build first, ask for permission later**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Screensaver is dope... check out their [Discord](https://discord.gg/wGdTeU3kk4) for art drops, bidding wars, flash auctions, and more.
{% endhint %}

### How much are VIBES worth?

**VIBES** are worth whatever somebody is willing to pay for them. **VIBES** are worth the value of the tokenized representation of holding a VIBES NFT over time. **VIBES** are worth the equivalent amount of **MATIC** \(or any other digital asset\) that can be used to purchase bags on [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0xd269af9008c674b3814b4830771453d6a30616eb). **VIBES** are worth the perceived value of having control over the VIBES art collective and cryptonetwork.

{% hint style="info" %}
ü§î All of these answers are correct. The real question is: what are **VIBES** worth to you?
{% endhint %}

### Can I seed my own NFTs with VIBES?

For now, this is a permissioned feature that is not widely available. VIBES artists are currently chosen by the [VIBES multisig](community/governance.md#vibes-multisig) and allocated **VIBES** to inject their NFTs with via the [Provenance Mining Grant Program](vibes-protocol/vibes-token/#provenance-mining-grant-program).

{% page-ref page="community/artists.md" %}

A product is in development known as **VIBES Lab** that will allow anybody to "BYO-VIBES" and seed any NFT they currently own with **VIBES** from their wallet.

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/vibes-lab.md" %}

### What is VIBES Party?

VIBES Party is an upcoming product that will allow VIBES members to exercise their protocol vote power to bid, collect, and sell NFTs as a decentralized collective via fully on-chain mechanics.

What happens when we plug in the VIBES hive mind into NFT marketplaces? What would that collection end up looking like? How could the power of collective action and pooled capital impact the NFT space?

**Let's build it and find out.**

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/vibes-party.md" %}

### How can I get the VIBES airdrop?

The **VIBES** airdrop program ran until July 12th, 2021 and is no longer active. All recipients of the initial airdrop are considered **Founding Members** of VIBES.

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/vibes-token/where-to-get-vibes.md" %}

### Where can I buy VIBES NFTs?

All VIBES NFTs are currently minted on [Screensaver.World](https://screensaver.world), so check out their marketplace and community. You can also visit the VIBES site at [sickvibes.xyz](https://sickvibes.xyz)

### How do I claim mined VIBES?

If you own a **VIBES** NFT that has claimable **VIBES**, you can use the Claim UI from the Token Detail page to claim the VIBES from your wallet. This is a one way operation!

{% page-ref page="resources/guides/how-to-claim-vibes-from-an-nft.md" %}

### What is Provenance Mining?

VIBES NFTs continuously mine **VIBES** inside of them as an intrinsically staked digital asset. The owner of the NFT can [claim](resources/guides/how-to-claim-vibes-from-an-nft.md) the mined **VIBES** at any time, which is a one-way operation. Mined **VIBES** stay inside the NFTs across sales or transfers.

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/provenance-mining/" %}

### What is Governance Farming?

Supply market liquidity for **VIBES** and farm a \(non-tokenized\) vote power multiplier. Governance farming stacks with liquidity mining. 

The governance farming program is not yet active.

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/governance-farming.md" %}

### What is Liquidity Mining?

Supply market liquidity for **VIBES** and earn. Liquidity mining stacks with governance farming. 

The liquidity mining program is not yet active.

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/liquidity-mining.md" %}

### How do I join VIBES?

Becoming a VIBES member starts in your heart. If you want to build cool stuff with NFTs or make sick art, you're already most of the way there.

If you want to make it official, grab some **VIBES** and hop into the [Discord](https://discord.gg/qDrsjcGR2F).

{% page-ref page="vibes-protocol/vibes-token/where-to-get-vibes.md" %}

### How do I contribute to VIBES?

Build something cool. Write something awesome. Make dope memes. Shitpost on Twitter to hype the collective. Edit these docs for spellign mistakes. 

Contributing earns you **VIBES**, and everyone likes getting stacked.

{% page-ref page="community/contributing.md" %}

### How do I get the VIBES Member role in Discord?

Discord roles are managed automatically via the [Collab Land](https://collab.land) bot.

{% page-ref page="resources/guides/how-to-get-vibes-discord-roles.md" %}

### How are new VIBES artists added?

This is currently done on a case-by-case basis and is a permissioned action. If you have somebody in mind that would make a an awesome VIBES artist, reach out to the [VIBES multisig](community/governance.md#vibes-multisig).

{% page-ref page="community/artists.md" %}

### How did you "hack" Screensaver World NFTs to mine VIBES?

That expression is a verbal abstraction -- a phrase that evokes the right understanding while being a lossy representation of the actual on-chain mechanisms that mediate the feature.

"I hacked my Screensaver World NFTs to continuously mine VIBES over time" is more accurately said as "I deployed a bookkeeping contract that references the Screensaver NFT contract and locks **VIBES** that can be released via a time-lock mechanism".

{% page-ref page="resources/architecture.md" %}

### What is the VIBES Multisig?

The [VIBES multisig](community/governance.md#vibes-multisig) is an executive group that requires 3-of-5 consensus to transfer [treasury funds](vibes-protocol/vibes-token/treasury-allocations.md) and control the [protocol smart contracts](resources/architecture.md).

### Will VIBES make me rich? Should I sell my VIBES? Is VIBES a good investment?

**VIBES** is designed to be a coordination and utility token.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**VIBES** is not a currency, financial instrument, or security. 

The token and other contracts have not been audited by a third party.
